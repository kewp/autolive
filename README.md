# autolive

have live python running - edit the text file and it will
run automatically, and show errors!

want to hook this up to `auto` and have the output shown
straight away...

## running

to setup run `npm install` and then `vite` (should install vite globally,
maybe with `npm install -g vite`, not sure...)

## old readme (3 sept 2021)

Live edit auto scripts that cache on filesystem and aws services

I want to create a front-end that allows live editing - a built-in
script editor... that as you make changes it instantly shows you
what the results are ...

and what also sync with the filesystem?

i want to connect the two use-cases of auto i've tried - automatically
updating objects / variables using functions, and doing the same
thing via the file system.

and i also want to try implement the same thing using aws - trying to
develop what might be the ideal development system for a website,
having the entire thing be this small dev tool, this tiny ui that
is just a file that i'm editing and it shows me what the results
are ... i want to see immediately what is happening

i should call this autolive ...
